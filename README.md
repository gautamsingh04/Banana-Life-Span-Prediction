# Banana-Life-Span-Prediction

• Developed a deep learning model using MobileNetV2 to classify banana ripeness and predict its eatable days.
• Preprocessed images with augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, flips) for better model generalization.
• Trained on categorized banana images, fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy.
• Implemented a custom prediction function to map quality ratings to eatable days.
• Utilized TensorFlow & Keras for model building, training, and evaluation.
• Achieved reliable test accuracy and visualized training progress with Matplotlib.
• Saved the model for real-world deployment and further improvements
